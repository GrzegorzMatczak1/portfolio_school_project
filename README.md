navbar design ideas:

main webite: https://freefrontend.com/css-menu/

toggable welcome menu: https://codepen.io/TheMOZZARELLA/pen/gOePxaN (Didnt use that but it kinda gave me an idea to add some cose with js)

3 fancy links: https://codepen.io/jhancock532/pen/GRZrLwY (I would have changed all the colours but the orange and cyan is my favourite so i only darkened the purple button so it would fit better)

This is my portfolio project. I had put alot of work into it and i hope you like it :).

You can also point out some mistakes if there are any
